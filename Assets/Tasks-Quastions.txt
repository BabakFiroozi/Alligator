* Predefined area
	-Creating: Go to to 'Menu Bar -> Game Tools -> Create Territory Area'
	-Editing: Select yellow points and move them to edit.
	-Extending: Click on green point to create new points;
	-Set Spawn Prefab: Drag the prefab 'Prefabs -> Alligator' to 'Spawn Prefab' property.
	-Create Alligator: Click the button 'Spawn Quadruped'.
	-Reset: Click the button 'Reset' to back to the intial shape.
	-Ceneter: Click the button 'Center' to bring pivot in center.
	-Full undo redo actions support

* Alligator
	-Select the alligator in the scene and click the button 'Select Territory Area' to edit its area.
	-State Params: Tewak paramters toghether to gain a gentle movement.
		1. Wander_Speed: move speed
		2. Wander_Randomness: changing direction randomness
		3. Wander_Radius: circle reference radius
	

	
* Other solutions
	-Editor:
		1. Creating many game objects attached to parent as area points where adding and removing nodes is time consuming but
		   it is simple.
		2. Making collision around the area like this editor. Then change the path when reach the wall with ray casting. 
		   With more than one ray cast this is not bad solution too.
	-Agent:
		1. We can randomly put a point on ground to reach there and put again but after some movements it becoms a repetitive
		   chain of movements. it is simple and is not a very bad solution.

* Expansion
	-Editor: Creating more agents at once is easy with one click and only needs implementation of finding random points
			 in area. Can be used for second solution too(collision solution).			 
	-Agent: New state can be easily added for new behaviour. state only need calculate movement direction and set it to the agent.
			Grouping behaviours can be easily added.


			
* Potential bugs
	-Agent may go out of the area at very high speed movement
	-In very tight and complex situations may have unintentional behaviour or glitch
